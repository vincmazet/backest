# Background Estimation in Chemical Spectra

This program estimates the background (or baseline) of optical spectra by the polynomial minimizing a cost function. If the cost function was quadratic, the solution is the least squares estimation, which is not appropriate in this problem. Instead, we need to use of non-quadratic cost function such as the symmetrical Huber function, the symmetrical truncated quadratic or their respective asymmetrical shape.

The program is written in Matlab and should work with Matlab 6 (or higher).
* `demo` allows you to run the program with a simulated spectrum;
* `backcor` is the main function which can be run with or without a graphical user interface.

Type `help backcor` in Matlab to get the syntax of the function.
